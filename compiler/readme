DO NOT RUN THINGS FROM INSIDE THE COMPILER DIRECTORY, be outside of it

Just run "./compiler/setup" and you should be set to use compile, execute and interpret. Do compiler for some info

IF IT DOESNT RUN:
do "chmod u+x compiler/perms" then do "./compiler/perms"
Try again after that.

The install is silent, any interuptions is likely an error. Run it once, it appends to the end of .bashrc, and doesnt care if the stuff is already there, so running setup multiple times will just clog your .bashrc file and will also yoink all your storage.
